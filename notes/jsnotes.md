## Basic things to remember

### 1. Always use camelCase

+ When using camel case, the first word starts with a small letter and the succeeding words starts with capital letter.  

    **Example:**  

    ```js
    var currentAge;
    ```

### 2. Variable naming convention

+ Always name your variables describing the value it holds or the type of assignment it has.

    **Example:** Declare a variable that will store the starting price of a product.

    ```js
    let itemStartingPrice = 0;
    ```

+ A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0 â€“ 9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z (lowercase).

    **Example of legal variable names:**  
    `Number_hits`, `temp99`, `$credit`, and `_name`
